                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nirmal Art</b>, encompassing a 400-year-old tradition of making soft wood toys and paintings, occupies a place of pride in the world of <b>handicrafts</b>. 
                    The finely carved figures and dainty paintings are still being used to decorate drawing rooms in thousands of homes across the country. <b>Nirmal district</b> in Telangana 
                    was once famous as a production centre of as diverse things as cannons and toys. While the foundry supplied heavy artillery to the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Naqqash craftsmen 
                    and artists brought out exquisite <b>wooden toys and duco paintings</b> under the name of Nirmal Art. The foundry was closed soon after Hyderabad's accession, but the art form has survived many ups and downs, 
                    the most impacting being the loss of its patron, the Nizam. Elegant toys and paintings continue to be produced by the Naqqash artisans at this town located just 4 km off the 
                    new four lane National Highway No. 44 about 220 km from Hyderabad. Though no records pertaining to their origins exist now, it is believed the <b>Naqqash</b> families were brought here from Rajasthan in the 17th century by <b>Neema Naik</b> 
                    (or Nimma Naidu according to another version), the local chieftain after whom the town itself is named. Many changes have since been incorporated in their art form obviously to suit the taste of the patrons of the time<br/><br/>
